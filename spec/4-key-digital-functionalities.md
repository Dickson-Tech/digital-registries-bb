# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

The Digital Registries Building Block is an application meant to offer fast and intuitive database management functionalities to entities without the need for database experts. The Digital Registries Building Block is simple to use like online Excel with advanced data management and connectivity options for advanced users. Digital Registries Building Block is a multi-tenant platform where users can create and manage new registry databases. Each registry database created in the system will have automatically REST services generated.

The first user of the Building Block is an **Administrator/Analyst** who is building a new registry. The Analyst is the person who is building the new registry database, changing the existing database configuration, or simply administering the API user authorization. The Administrator/analyst is using a web user interface.&#x20;
