# 2 Description

The Digital Registries Building Block no-code development platform uses graphical wizards to create and build software, unlike the traditional approach which uses computer programming languages. It is simple to use, similar to online Excel with advanced data management, log, and connectivity options for advanced users. Each register created in the system has a simple User Interface to see and edit data and an API connector with automatically created Open API services for machine-to-machine communication. The Digital Registry System does not contain data capturing and workﬂow functionality, however, if a user interface and data processing is needed then Digital Registries can be combined with other GovStack building blocks (e.g. the [Registration Building Block](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/bb-registration/tree/1.0-QA)) as a plug-and-play.

It provides services to other Building Blocks and to external systems, to store and manage data/claims on any entity (persons, places, and things) in forms of uniquely identiﬁable records in a database.

For example, these records could contain health and medical information, ownership of property, vehicles, money, qualiﬁcations, birth/expiry of people and entities, land surveys, manufacturing information of vehicles and equipment, banking and commercial transactions, etc. Given the diversity of such information, this Building Block provides services useful to abstract the structure, linkages, and grouping of information into various records and collections such as ﬁnancial, legal, medical, social, educational, commercial, etc., as needed.

The Building Block provides the capability to capture, store, search, distribute, and present data with zero or minimal need for software development. It also maintains and reports logs of all operations taking place on schemas and data. It contains various functional components, and data resources to abstract away all the details and complexity, and to expose capabilities as service-APIs to external Building Blocks/applications.

The Digital Registries Building Block is an optional Building Block for other GovStack Building Blocks that have the need to store information. Any traditional database platform could be used alone or in combination with Digital Registries Building Block. The Digital Registries Building Block can operate as a standalone service and could be implemented as one centralized instance per domain, containing multiple registries in one instance, or many instances per domain, each database in its own server.
