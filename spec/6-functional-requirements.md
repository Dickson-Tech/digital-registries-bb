# 6 Functional Requirements

## 6.1 Administrative/Analyst Functions <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d85f59a4-7fff-1564-6ae2-86d67f36a258" id="docs-internal-guid-d85f59a4-7fff-1564-6ae2-86d67f36a258"></a>

* DRS-1: Analysts have the option to create a new registry database by filling in the following information (REQUIRED):
  1. Name of the database;
  2. A short name;
  3. Schema of the database (see DRS-3).
* DRS-2: Analysts can create multiple databases in one system instance. Databases must be linkable with foreign keys. See the foreign key API description example in [Appendix 2](.gitbook/assets/appendix2.json). Analysts can configure which databases and which fields are linked. In this document and foreign key function, we consider databases as database tables that can be linked with one another. See the [example illustration](.gitbook/assets/Database%20Foreign%20key.png). User story: As a user, I can browse database content (Data) in the user interface and when databases are linked, then I can click and move from one database/table to another where the corresponding linked data will open in the user interface. In the Digital Registries Data user interface, it should be possible to open another database by clicking on the record ID in one database and all corresponding records from the other Database will open. It is required to have at least two levels of IDs (database ID and field ID) to link the databases. See the example API in[ Appendix 2](.gitbook/assets/appendix2.json). Example: In one registry database we store information about Mother and Child records. In the second registry database, we store information about payments made for the mother. The system must enable a foreign key link between the payment database to the Mother and child record database. Users can click in the payment database record user interface to the Mother ID field and the system user interface should open the corresponding record in the Mother and Child database. (REQUIRED)
*   DRS-3: Analysts have the option to add fields to the database schema. Fields of the database must contain at least the following elements (REQUIRED):

    1. Field name;
    2. Field type, at least with the following types:
       1. Text;
       2. Number;

       8. List/Array/Edit grid (sub-table/array of values inside a field);
       9. Block container (optional, to group fields visually);
       10. List of Values/Catalog (holding value and key).

    3\. Field properties (see more in DRS-33)

## Building Block Components

The Building Block has a user interface to query and consult the registry data but in most cases, the Applicants are using the end client applications like Registration Building Block to access the registry. Any Building Block can query data from Digital Registries Building Block via APIs if authorization is given.
